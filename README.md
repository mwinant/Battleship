# Battleship

## Overview

C++ program that simulates the game of [Battleship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Battleship is a two-player Navy game. The objective of the game is to sink all ships in your enemy's fleet. The Player to sink his/her enemy's fleet first wins.

Both players' fleets consist of 5 ships that are hidden from the enemy. Each ship may be differentiated by its "size" (besides the Cruiser and Submarine) or number of cells it expands on the game board:
1. Carrier has 5 cells
2. Battleship has 4 cells
3. Cruiser has 3 cells
4. Submarine has 3 cells
5. Destroyer has 2 cells.
The program should be built such that the user is Player1 and the computer is Player2.

## Program Details

- [ ] **Two boards** (2-dimensional arrays of chars) exist within the game. 
    * Each 2-dimensional array should be 10 X 10. 
    * One represents Player1's board and one represents Player2's board. 
- [ ] At the beginning of the game, each Players' game board should be initialized to all dashes `-` indicating that no ships have been placed on either board.
- [ ] Before the game starts, Player1 should have the option to either:
    - [ ] manually place each of the 5 ships in his/her fleet or 
    - [ ] to have them randomly placed on the board. 
    - If Player1 decides to place the ships manually, then he/she should be prompted to place the Carrier first, Battleship second, Cruiser third, Submarine fourth, and the Destroyer last. 
    - **Note:** Ships cannot be placed diagonally on the board, they can *only be placed vertically or horizontally* (you don't need to check for this); 
    - [ ] **Validate** if the user tries to place a ship outside the boundaries of the board or on top of a ship that has already been placed.

Each cell on the board that contains part of the ship must be indicated by 
* `c` for Carrier, 
* `b` for Battleship, 
* `r` for Cruiser, 
* `s` for Submarine, or 
* `d` for Destroyer. 

For example, if the Carrier was placed then the board should contain 5 `c` for each cell on the board that has a piece of the Carrier, etc.
